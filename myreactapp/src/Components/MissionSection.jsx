          and camera maniacs together. Where they would have a place to log all
          their gear, so that they would see and know their current inventory.
          By adding distinct descriptions to their uploaded gear, others who
          join the platform, will have the opportunityto see other people
          gallerys and gear, which might give them some idea about the specific
          camera from another persons view.
